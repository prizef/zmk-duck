ZMK Firmware is an open source (MIT) keyboard
firmware built on the [Zephyrâ„¢ Project](https://zephyrproject.org/) Real Time Operating System (RTOS). ZMK's goal is to provide a modern, wireless, and powerful firmware free of licensing issues.

## Features

ZMK is currently missing some features found in other popular firmware. This table compares the features supported by ZMK, BlueMicro and QMK:
