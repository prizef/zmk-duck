# Keymap Upgrader

Many codes have been renamed to be more consistent with each other.
Paste the contents of a `.keymap` file below to upgrade all deprecated codes to their replacements.

Hover your mouse over the upgraded keymap and click the `Copy` button to copy it to your clipboard.

You will likely need to realign columns in the upgraded keymap. The upgrader also does not handle
codes inside a `#define`, so you will need to update those manually using
[this list of deprecated codes and replacements](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/blob/main/docs/src/data/keymap-upgrade.js).

import KeymapUpgrader from "@site/src/components/KeymapUpgrader/index";
