title: Native Posix board target
---

In order to iterate quickly on firmware features, it can
be helpful to build and run the firmware on your local
workstation, with generated virtual press/release events
flowing into the handler functions.

## Prerequisites

In order to build targeting the `native_posix` board, you need to setup your system
with a compiler that can target 32-bit POSIX.

On Debian, you can do this with:

```
apt install -y gcc-multilib
```

## Building

To do this, you can build ZMK targeting the
`native_posix` board.

```
west build --pristine --board native_posix
```

Once built, you can run the firmware locally:

```
./build/zephyr/zephyr.exe
```

## Virtual Key Events

The virtual key presses are hardcoded in `boards/native_posix.overlay` file, should you want to change the sequence to test various actions like Mod-Tap, etc.
